                  <p>Dogs and other people have lived together for many millennia. Obviously, humans and dogs were intended to be companions, and both parties are content with the arrangement. However, your dog should be properly cared for. Here are several tips that can help you keep your dog healthy.Your own home must be dog-proofed. Check your whole home to make certain that it really is safe before bringing a pet dog home. Put away all your cleaning supplies and medicines, and make certain you place away any trash cans. Some plants can be lethal, so move them out of your dog’s reach.

                  <p>When getting a new dog, it is actually best that you just schedule a check-up at the vet right away. The veterinarian is going to do a total checkup and set up a schedule for his vaccinations. You should also confer with your vet concerning your dog being spayed or neutered as there is an overpopulation of dogs in shelters.

                    Be sure that your dog understands how to properly walk while it’s leashed. Make him walk on your side, and do not let him pull far in front of you or stay far behind. Utilize the command “heel” to prompt him. When you walk this way, you will be certain that your dog is safe so that your walks are more enjoyable. Even when you use a loose leash walk, it’s still necessary for the family pet to learn this command.
                    
                    Being a dog owner, you should return your dog’s affection with responsible, reliable care so you can keep your dog happy and healthy.
